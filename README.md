- Optical Flow is a pattern for any movement between two consecutive images caused by the movement of a camera or object.

- It is 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second.

- Optical flow works on several assumptions:

  1. The pixel intensities of an object do not change between consecutive frames.
  2. Neighbouring pixels have similar motion.

- The goal is to calculate dense optical flow for a video  using Gunnar Farneback algorithm
